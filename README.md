# ByteLock 🔐

ByteLock is a Python-based **Educational Ransomware Simulation Tool** created for learning, ethical hacking, and cybersecurity awareness training purposes **only**. It demonstrates how ransomware-type attacks can encrypt files and demand a "ransom" to decrypt them — without actually causing real harm when used responsibly in safe, isolated environments.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for educational use only in secure and lawful environments (e.g., labs, VMs). Misuse of ByteLock in real-world systems is illegal and unethical. The author is not responsible for any misuse or damages caused.
